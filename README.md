Submitted by: **John Nellimala Varghese**

Time spent: **3+** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
* A 'clear' button (the little x) shows up when editing the bill amount.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

These are not really major challenges but minor obstacles and hoops I had to jump through.
* As I was recording the demo in LiceCap, I discovered that the software keyboard was not showing up. A google search revealed that I have to fix it with from the 'Hardware' menu. Then I rememebered, that it was mentioned in the video. Although, I'm not sure why it went away in the first place.
* Doing the optional recommended step seems a bit unintuitive. I will figure it out eventually though.
* Trying unsolicited steps incorrectly led to run time exceptions. But I was able to fix them soon enough.
